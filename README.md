Full Stack Development 1 
Dwaine Brannon

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
  Using a SPA was different than developing the code for the backend. In the SPA, we called a lot of references to the backend data, and used api interactions to fetch that data. The data was all displayed on the single page, reducing load times between url links, and just feeling better for the user. On the backend, it was a traditional type of webpage with multiple different pages that had things like trip data. 
  
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?
 NoSQL databases have flexibility in how you store and retreieve the data. The Schema doesn't have to be structured the same way every time. This means we can allow the client to add more "Fields" into the data, if they need. NoSQL databases are also fast, which is what we want when making so many requsts in the broswer. 

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
  JSON is a way to store data and for JavaScript to read from. It's structered in key-value pairs for databases. Javascript reads the JSON files, brings the data into the application, and allows functions within the app to use that data. 
  
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.
  I did not do that. There was a lot of debugging. I really disliked the source material for this class, it made things extremely hard. 

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.
  Methods are functions. They take in variables and describe the logic. What to do with those variables. 
  Endpoints are, i believe, the subpage of your website. Like "localhost:3000/api/trips" it's where the data is going to go.

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
  I had to debug a lot of issues, and collaborate with my classmates, who were having the same issues, because the course material is outdated. A lot of us had toruble, and I believe that the collaborative environment that I had is going to be beneficial to me in the future when debugging code. I'm going to run into old technology and outdated stuff a lot. I need to be able to communicate with my peers, and reach a solution.
